　　As consumers’ demand and satisfaction have been improved rapidly, a growing number of businesses place great emphasis on the relationship with customers. I am of an opinion that trust building, to some extent, plays a rather important role between companies and consumers.

　　Several possible reasons accountable for my statement are included as follows.

A convincing occurring to me goes to my shopping experience. It is the deep understanding and trust that enable me to buy all my clothes in the same brand. For another, barely can companies have more clients without maintaining the trust with their regular customers. It is beyond the dispute that one customer will recommend their trusted companies to more friends, which can facilitate businesses to gain more money.

　　To sum up, trust exerts a series of positive effects on the progress of business. Only connecting trust with consumers can companies thrive faster and longer.
